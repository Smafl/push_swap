`ToDo:
! ./push_swap "" should be error
! remove -g flag from
 libft
 ft_printf
 push_swap
-------------------------------------------------
Error:

! If no parameters are specified
(or they have been already sorted),
the program must not display anything and
give the prompt back

! In case of error, it must display "Error"
followed by a ’\n’ on the standard error.
Errors include for example:
 some arguments aren’t integers
 some arguments are bigger than an integer
 and/or there are duplicates
-------------------------------------------------
Output:

! If no parameters are specified, the program
must not display anything and give the prompt
back

! The program must display the smallest list
of instructions possible to sort the stack a,
the smallest number being at the top.
! Instructions must be separated by a ’\n’ and
nothing else.

Input:

./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8

Algorithms
copy array
sort it
find the middle value
run through stack a
numbers less than the middle put in stack b
numbers more than the middle put at bottom of stack a
remember this chanck in stack b
repeat all with stack a until there stay 2-3 max value
then sort every chank in stack b and put in in stack a
